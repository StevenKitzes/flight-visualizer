      <strong>Note:</strong> Hover over any point to get more detailed information about that specific flight.
      The more <span style="color:red;">red</span> a point is, the more aggressively
      that flight is descending.  Likewise, the more <span style="color:green;">green</span> a point is the
      more aggressively it is ascending.  The more <strong>white</strong> a point is, the closer to level
      flight.

    <p id='notes'>
      Some flights appear to have extremely high altitude or velocity.  It has been suggested on forums that
      these may be military or research vessels.  I have no idea.  They throw off the scale of the graph, I
      acknowledge.  This is a target for future improvement (an option for you to turn off extremes, or to
      otherwise be able to zoom in on the graph).
